# Webpage For Pre Work Study Guide!

## Description

The pre work part of the bootcamp was to help us be prepaid for the knowledge coming our way very shortly. For an inexperianced coder, this prework sets the foundation of our studies, and allows to understand it's effects in the real world. Pre work is engaging and challenges you to learn forgein concepts. 

## Installation

The process undertaken to get this project from started to completed occured via the following steps. These steps include, an introduction to Git, registering for Github; creating a new repository. From here, outline issues or focuses for your repository, and set the expectations for your issues. This now allows us to have blueprint for what we want to achieve, and we can begin the coding process. The steps taken happen in order from HTML, CSS, and lastly JavaScript.Hypertext markup language (HTML) is considered the structure of our web application, the foundation. Casscading style sheets (CSS) is the visual appeal of our web application. Lastly, JavaScript is the system that brings our web application to life. Whilst that was a brief summary, many steps to getting to coding were undertaken, including linking our Github to our local computer to work remotely, learning how to continually to pull our work on to Github as some brief examples.

## Usage
To get to the final stage of a web application prior to deployment we had essentially four main parts. Firstly, HTML, Secondly, adding CSS styles into our site, then lastly two seperate steps of JavaScript covering loops and functions. As seen below are four images that represent the process sequentially.
